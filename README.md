# Forensic-Sketch-analyzer
A cool GUI based app where you need to upload a sketch and it will give the most relevant picture from the database provided to the sketch.

This is app uses Face_recognition as an dependency in which the model is already trained using siamese network and the model generates encoding of the input image.
It uses dlib and openface for face detection and aligning purpose.
